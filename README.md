ggogick-docpad
==============

Commented skeleton of my personal site for reference purposes.

I'm using [DocPad](http://docpad.org) to by and large generate static files, which are served via Apache.  This allows me to handle the one-off case of needing dynamic goodness for my contact form, which is handled via PHP.

Other fun things include paging, tagging and clean URLs, all wrapped up in wonderful [eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco) goodness.

The skeleton is pointedly not meant to be a showcase of Bootstrap/HTML5/design skills, but hey, if you're looking for something minimalist, be my guest.
